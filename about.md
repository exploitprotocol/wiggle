{% include navbar.html %}

I am a junior CS undergraduate here at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee. My interests includes Data Science, Programming Languages, Linux, Web and Open Source Software Development. And APIs and CLIs too.

Whenever I'm around my laptop, I can be found shuffling between vim's splitted windows and listening to Coldplay's O.

Music is one of my best friends, I can sing my favorite songs pretty well. I have made a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5hSueDZEA0FsDlDeAtBLYAHyr4-dlr9u) for you, It's a mix of everything.

I'm a big fan of Graffiti. You can find some of my masterpieces* on the last pages of my notebooks. I can whistle like Paul McCartney, not that cool but..

I wanted to be a loco pilot when I was a child. Then I wanted to join [ISRO](http://www.isro.gov.in/). But didn't make it there, hard luck probably.

I use the symbol \o/ to rejoice. Remember the [Calvin demanding a euphoria?](http://bit.ly/calvin-euphoria)
